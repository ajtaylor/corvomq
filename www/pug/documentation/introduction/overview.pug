    h3 Overview
    p CorvoMQ allows you to loosely couple heterogeneous systems together. There is no tight relationship between message producers and message consumers. The producers and consumers are independent and know nothing of each other. The ability to increase and decrease producers and consumers enables you to easily scale your systems to cope with changes in workload.
    p Provisioning is simple - there is no setup configuration nor maintenance required. You create and manage your CorvoMQ instances via the web interface.
